PIXELLAB - BASIC CHARACTER GENERATION
======================================

API Credits: 1000

1. Generating wizard character...
   Generated: (64, 64)

2. Generating knight with custom parameters...
   Generated: (64, 64)

âœ“ All images saved to: outputs/basic_characters/
```

## Step 5: Check Your Generated Images

Open the `outputs/` folder to see your generated pixel art!

```

## Quick Reference

### Generate a Character

```python
from pixellab_integration import PixelLabClient

client = PixelLabClient(api_key="your-key")

wizard = client.generate_character(
    description="fantasy wizard with blue robes",
    width=64,
    height=64,
    no_background=True
)

wizard.show()  # Display the image
```

### Create an Animation

```python
# Generate base character
base = client.generate_character("knight character")

# Animate it walking
walk_frames = client.animate_character_text(
    reference_image=base,
    description="knight character",
    action="walk",
    n_frames=4
)

# Create sprite sheet
sprite_sheet = client.create_sprite_sheet(
    walk_frames,
    columns=4,
    filename="knight_walk.png"
)
```

### 8-Directional Character

```python
from pixellab_integration import create_8_directional_character

directions_8 = create_8_directional_character(
    client,
    description="pixel art hero",
    width=64,
    height=64
)

# directions_8 is a dict: {'north': Image, 'east': Image, ...}
```
