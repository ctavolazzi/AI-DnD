## üí° Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- Strategic git commits made history clear
- Bootstrap script provides repeatable setup
- Demo testing validated without Ollama dependency
- cursor-coding-protocols integration seamless

### What Needed Attention
- Ollama response time slower than expected
- Model loading causes initial delays
- Need timeout handling for AI calls

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Test with smaller model (llama3.2:3b) for faster responses
2. Add timeout configuration to narrative engine
3. Implement graceful degradation if Ollama unavailable
