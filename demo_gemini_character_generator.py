The cobblestones of Waterdeep's Dock Ward were slick with rain as Aria Shadowbane slipped through the shadows, her keen elven ears picking up the distant sound of the city watch's boots on wet stone. She had learned long ago that survival in this city required more than just skill with a blade‚Äîit demanded the ability to read people, to understand their motivations, and to know when to strike and when to fade into the darkness.

Tonight, however, was different. The information she had gathered about the missing children had led her to this abandoned warehouse, and she could hear the faint sounds of crying from within. Her heart clenched as memories of her own childhood flooded back‚Äîthe nights spent huddled in doorways, the constant fear, the desperate hope that someone, anyone, would care enough to help.

But she was no longer that helpless child. She was Aria Shadowbane, and she had made a promise to herself that no child would suffer as she had. Drawing her daggers, she prepared to enter the warehouse, knowing that whatever awaited her inside would test not just her skills, but her very soul.
