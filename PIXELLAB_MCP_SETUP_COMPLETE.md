# PixelLab MCP Integration - Complete Setup Guide

## ✅ CONFIGURATION COMPLETE!

Your PixelLab MCP server is now fully configured and ready to use. Here's everything you need to know:

---

## 🎯 What's Been Set Up

### 1. MCP Server Configuration
**File:** `.cursor/mcp.json`
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pixellab": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "pixellab-mcp", "--secret=${PIXELLAB_API_KEY}"],
      "env": {
        "PIXELLAB_API_KEY": "${PIXELLAB_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. API Key Configuration
**Environment Variable:** `PIXELLAB_API_KEY`
**Setup:** Set your API key as an environment variable
**Location:** Configured in MCP server environment
**Security:** No hardcoded keys in configuration files

### 3. Existing Integration
**Location:** `pixellab_integration/` directory
- ✅ 650+ line Python client (`pixellab_client.py`)
- ✅ 6 comprehensive examples (1,100+ lines total)
- ✅ Complete API coverage (character generation, animation, rotation, inpainting)
- ✅ Game-ready asset generation capabilities

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 0: Set Your API Key
**IMPORTANT:** Set your PixelLab API key as an environment variable:
```bash
export PIXELLAB_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### Step 1: Restart Claude Code
**CRITICAL:** You must restart Claude Code for the MCP server to load.

### Step 2: Test MCP Tools
Once restarted, you can use PixelLab tools directly in Claude Code:
- Generate pixel art characters
- Create animations
- Rotate and transform sprites
- Generate tilesets

### Step 3: Test Python Client (Alternative)
```bash
cd pixellab_integration
python3 examples/01_basic_character_generation.py
```

## 🎨 Available Capabilities

### Character Generation
- Text-to-pixel-art with custom styles
- 4 or 8 directional views for top-down games
- Customizable outline, shading, and detail levels
- Isometric projection support
- Transparent backgrounds

### Animation
- Walk, run, attack, idle cycles
- Text-based animation ("walk", "run", "attack")
- Skeleton-based animation with keypoint control
- 4-8+ frames per animation
- Automatic sprite sheet generation

### Image Manipulation
- Direction rotation (N→S, E→W, etc.)
- View changes (side→front→back)
- 360° rotation sequences
- Inpainting (edit specific regions)
- Style transfer and variations

### Game-Ready Assets
- Complete character asset sets
- Master sprite sheet compilation
- Ready for Unity, Godot, GameMaker, Pygame
- Batch generation for multiple directions

## 🔧 Integration Options

### Option 1: MCP Server (Recommended)
- Use PixelLab tools directly in Claude Code
- AI assistant can generate assets on-demand
- Seamless integration with your coding workflow
- Perfect for rapid prototyping

### Option 2: Python Client
- Use existing `pixellab_integration/` Python client
- More control over generation parameters
- Better for batch operations
- Can be integrated into your game code

### Option 3: Both (Hybrid)
- Use MCP for quick generation during development
- Use Python client for production asset generation
- Best of both worlds
