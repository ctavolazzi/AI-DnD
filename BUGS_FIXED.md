# 🐛 Bugs Fixed - Build Session

## ✅ Critical Bugs SQUASHED

### 1. **Encounter Stacking Bug** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- Encounters would stack on top of each other
- Multiple combat choice buttons appeared
- Could spam encounters

**Root Cause:**
- No combat state tracking
- No duplicate prevention

**Solution:**
```javascript
gameState.inCombat = false  // Added combat state flag
gameState.lastEncounterLocation = null  // Track where encounters happen
gameState.encounterCooldown = 0  // Cooldown counter

// Prevent duplicate choices
const existingChoices = viewport.querySelectorAll('.choices');
existingChoices.forEach(choice => choice.remove());
```

**Result:** ✅ Encounters now properly isolated, no more stacking!

---

### 2. **Couldn't Move After Encounter** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- Combat state never cleared
- Players stuck in "combat mode" forever

**Solution:**
```javascript
function endCombat() {
    gameState.inCombat = false;
    gameState.encounterCooldown = 3; // Safe moves before next encounter
    addText('━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━', 'success');
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Can move freely after combat resolves!

---

### 3. **Encounter Rate Too High** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- 30% chance on EVERY move = constant combat
- Couldn't explore peacefully

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Before: 0.3 (30%)
// After: 0.15 (15%)
if (gameState.encounterCooldown === 0 &&
    Math.random() < 0.15 &&
    gameState.lastEncounterLocation !== locationKey)
```

**Result:** ✅ Reduced to 15% + cooldown system = much more balanced!

---

### 4. **Multi-Round Combat Not Working** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- Combat ended immediately even if enemy had HP left
- No way to attack multiple times

**Solution:**
```javascript
if (encounter.hp <= 0) {
    // Victory
    endCombat();
} else {
    // Enemy still alive, continue combat
    addText(`${encounter.enemy} HP: ${encounter.hp}`, 'combat');
    choicesDiv.remove();
    showCombatChoices(encounter);  // Show choices again
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Multi-round combat now works! Fight until enemy is defeated!

---

### 5. **Failed Sneak = Stuck** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- Failed sneak check ended encounter instead of forcing combat

**Solution:**
```javascript
if (total >= 12) {
    // Success - escape
    endCombat();
} else {
    // Failed - forced into combat
    showCombatChoices(encounter);  // Re-show combat options
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Failed sneak now properly forces you into combat!

---

## 🎯 New Features Added

### 1. **Location-Based Dialogue** ✨ NEW
```javascript
const locationDialogues = {
    '3,2': ["Tavern dialogue..."],
    '3,1': ["Town Square dialogue..."],
    '4,2': ["Market dialogue..."],
    // etc.
}
```

**Locations with dialogue:**
- 🍺 Starting Tavern (4 NPCs)
- 🏛️ Town Square (3 NPCs)
- 🛒 Market Street (3 NPCs)
- ⚒️ Blacksmith (3 NPCs)
- 🚪 City Gates (3 NPCs)

**Result:** ✅ Each location now has unique NPCs to talk to!

---

### 2. **Quest Completion System** ✨ NEW
```javascript
function completeObjective(index) {
    gameState.objectives[index].completed = true;
    objectiveElement.classList.add('completed');
    addText(`🎯 Quest Updated: ${text}`, 'quest');
}
```

**First Quest Trigger:**
- Talk to NPCs in Starting Tavern → Completes "Gather your party"

**Result:** ✅ Quests can now be completed dynamically!

---

### 3. **Combat Cooldown System** ✨ NEW
```javascript
gameState.encounterCooldown = 3;  // 3 safe moves after combat
```

**Result:** ✅ Won't immediately encounter enemies after winning a fight!

---

### 4. **Context-Aware Actions** ✨ NEW
```javascript
if (gameState.inCombat) {
    addText("⚠️ You can't move during combat!", 'damage');
    return;
}
```

**Blocked during combat:**
- ❌ Movement
- ❌ Talking (with warning message)

**Result:** ✅ Game enforces turn-based combat rules!

---

## 📊 Before vs After

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Encounter Rate | 30% every move | 15% with 3-move cooldown |

| Multi-round Combat | ❌ Didn't work | ✅ Works perfectly |
| Encounter Stacking | ❌ Constant bug | ✅ Fixed |
| Dialogue | Generic random | Location-specific |
| Quest System | Static HTML | ✅ Dynamic tracking |
| Movement in Combat | ❌ Allowed (bug) | ✅ Blocked |

## 🧪 Testing Done

### Manual Tests ✅
- [x] Start encounter → Complete combat → Move freely
- [x] Attack until enemy defeated → Multi-round combat works
- [x] Failed sneak check → Forced into combat
- [x] Try to move during combat → Blocked with message
- [x] Talk in different locations → Unique dialogues
- [x] Complete first quest → Objective marked complete
- [x] Rapid movement → No duplicate encounters
- [x] Cooldown system → 3 safe moves after combat

---

## 🎮 How to Test

1. **Load the game** - Start in tavern
2. **Click TALK** - Should complete first quest objective
3. **Move EAST** to Market Street
4. **Keep moving** until encounter triggers
5. **Attack enemy** multiple times until defeated
6. **Check that you can move** after combat
7. **Try TALK** in different locations - should see unique dialogue

## 🐛 Known Issues (Future)

### Low Priority:
- Quest objectives 2-4 don't have triggers yet
- No inventory system (items hardcoded)
- No character progression (stats hardcoded)
- No save/load system

### Future Enhancements:
- AI-powered dialogue (mentioned by user)
- More quest triggers
- Item pickups
- Character leveling
- Boss encounters

## 📈 Code Quality Improvements

### Added:
- `gameState.inCombat` - Combat state tracking
- `gameState.lastEncounterLocation` - Prevent spam
- `gameState.encounterCooldown` - Safe movement buffer
