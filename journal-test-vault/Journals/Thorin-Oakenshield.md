Today I experienced Recruiting Bilbo.

Thorin and the company arrive at Bag End to recruit Bilbo Baggins as their burglar.

This happened at Bag End.

Gandalf the Grey and Bilbo Baggins were there with me.

I should write more about this later.

Today I experienced Secret Meeting.

Thorin meets with Gandalf to discuss the quest to reclaim Erebor.

This happened at The Prancing Pony Inn.

Gandalf the Grey was there with me.

I should write more about this later.

I am Thorin Oakenshield.

A proud dwarf warrior seeking to reclaim his homeland. Born into royalty but forced into exile, Thorin has become hardened by years of wandering and working menial jobs to survive.

My journey begins now.

I'm not sure what to make of Recruiting Bilbo.

It was described as: Thorin and the company arrive at Bag End to recruit Bilbo Baggins as their burglar.

I wonder what Gandalf the Grey and Bilbo Baggins thought about it...

I need to think more about what this means for me.
