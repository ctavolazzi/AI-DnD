Today I experienced Recruiting Bilbo.

Thorin and the company arrive at Bag End to recruit Bilbo Baggins as their burglar.

This happened at Bag End.

Thorin Oakenshield and Bilbo Baggins were there with me.

I should write more about this later.

Today I experienced Secret Meeting.

Thorin meets with Gandalf to discuss the quest to reclaim Erebor.

This happened at The Prancing Pony Inn.

Thorin Oakenshield was there with me.

I should write more about this later.

I'm not sure what to make of Recruiting Bilbo.

It was described as: Thorin and the company arrive at Bag End to recruit Bilbo Baggins as their burglar.

I wonder what Thorin Oakenshield and Bilbo Baggins thought about it...

I need to think more about what this means for me.
