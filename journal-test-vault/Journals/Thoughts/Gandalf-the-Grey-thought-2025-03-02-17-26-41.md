# Gandalf the Grey's Thought - 2025-03-02 17:26:41

## Internal Thought

I'm not sure what to make of Recruiting Bilbo.

It was described as: Thorin and the company arrive at Bag End to recruit Bilbo Baggins as their burglar.

I wonder what Thorin Oakenshield and Bilbo Baggins thought about it...

I need to think more about what this means for me.
