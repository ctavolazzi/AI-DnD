Today I experienced Recruiting Bilbo.

Thorin and the company arrive at Bag End to recruit Bilbo Baggins as their burglar.

This happened at Bag End.

Thorin Oakenshield and Gandalf the Grey were there with me.

I should write more about this later.

I am Bilbo Baggins.

A respectable hobbit from the Shire who loves comfort and routine.

My journey begins now.

I'm not sure what to make of Recruiting Bilbo.

It was described as: Thorin and the company arrive at Bag End to recruit Bilbo Baggins as their burglar.

I wonder what Thorin Oakenshield and Gandalf the Grey thought about it...

I need to think more about what this means for me.
