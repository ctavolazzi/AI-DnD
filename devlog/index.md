### Project Overview

The AI-DnD project is a text-based Dungeons & Dragons simulator that combines traditional role-playing game mechanics with AI-powered narrative generation. The main components include:

- **Game Engine**: Core gameplay mechanics, character management, combat system
- **Narrative Engine**: AI-powered storytelling using Ollama models
- **Rich Display**: Terminal-based UI for game visualization
- **World System**: Location management and navigation
- **Obsidian Integration**: Documentation system using Obsidian for tracking gameplay

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Codebase Exploration**: Analyzed the core components of the AI-DnD project, including the game engine and narrative generation system.

2. **Obsidian Integration Development**:
   - Created the `ObsidianLogger` class for writing game data to an Obsidian vault
   - Developed a demo script showcasing the integration (`obsidian_integration_demo.py`)
   - Set up a proper vault structure with appropriate Markdown formatting
   - Implemented internal linking between related game elements
   - Added automatic updating of character status, locations, and events

3. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive technical documentation
   - Developed a README for the Obsidian vault
   - Maintained progress tracking through the To-Do list

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining to-do items for the Obsidian integration
2. Test the integration with sample gameplay
3. Implement configuration options for greater flexibility
4. Continue exploration of the remaining core components
5. Investigate potential for bidirectional integration (reading from Obsidian back into the game)
