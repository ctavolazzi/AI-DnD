# AI-DnD Exploration Plan

This document outlines our systematic approach to exploring and documenting the AI-DnD codebase.

## Exploration Phases

### Phase 1: Core Architecture Overview (Completed)
- [x] Identify main components
- [x] Understand project structure
- [x] Document high-level architecture
- [x] Create initial exploration documentation

### Phase 2: Detailed Component Analysis
- [ ] Game Engine (dnd_game.py)
  - [ ] Character class implementation
  - [ ] Combat mechanics
  - [ ] Game state management
  - [ ] Turn progression logic

- [ ] Narrative Engine (narrative_engine.py)
  - [ ] Ollama integration
  - [ ] Prompt engineering approach
  - [ ] Narrative generation capabilities
  - [ ] Quest and encounter design

- [ ] User Interface (rich_game_display_integration.py)
  - [ ] Terminal UI implementation
  - [ ] Layout and rendering
  - [ ] User interaction handling
  - [ ] Visual design elements

- [ ] World System (world.py)
  - [ ] Location management
  - [ ] Navigation mechanics
  - [ ] World configuration loading
  - [ ] Environment descriptions

### Phase 3: Feature Investigation
- [ ] Character progression system
- [ ] Combat abilities and special moves
- [ ] AI-powered storytelling
- [ ] Game persistence (saving/loading)
- [ ] Configuration and extensibility

### Phase 4: Technical Analysis
- [ ] Code quality assessment
- [ ] Performance considerations
- [ ] Error handling and robustness
- [ ] Modularity and maintainability
- [ ] Testing approach

### Phase 5: Documentation and Summary
- [ ] Comprehensive architecture documentation
- [ ] Feature catalog
- [ ] Technical debt inventory
- [ ] Enhancement opportunities
- [ ] Final exploration report

## Exploration Methodology

For each component, we will:

1. **Read** the relevant source code
2. **Document** the key functionality and design patterns
3. **Trace** execution flows and data exchanges
4. **Analyze** strengths and potential improvements
5. **Summarize** findings in the dev log

## Progress Tracking

| Phase | Status | Completion Date |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| Phase 1 | Completed | Current Date |
| Phase 2 | Not Started | - |
| Phase 3 | Not Started | - |
| Phase 4 | Not Started | - |
| Phase 5 | Not Started | - |

## Next Steps

Our immediate focus will be Phase 2, starting with a detailed analysis of the game engine (dnd_game.py) to understand the core gameplay mechanics.
