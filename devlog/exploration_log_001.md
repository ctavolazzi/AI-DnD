# Exploration Log 001 - Initial Codebase Overview

## Date: Current Date

## Overview

Today I began exploring the AI-DnD codebase to understand its structure, components, and functionality. This log documents my initial findings and observations.

## Key Components Discovered

### Game Engine (dnd_game.py)

The core game engine is implemented in `dnd_game.py`, which manages the game state, characters, combat mechanics, and turn progression. This file contains:

- A `Character` class that implements character attributes, abilities, and combat actions
- Game mechanics for damage calculation, status effects, and character interactions
- A `DnDGame` class that orchestrates the overall game flow

The engine supports different character classes (Fighter, Wizard, Rogue, Cleric) and enemy types (Goblin, Orc, Skeleton, Bandit), each with unique abilities and attributes.

### Narrative Engine (narrative_engine.py)

The `NarrativeEngine` class uses the Ollama library to generate dynamic narrative content:

- Scene descriptions
- Combat narration
- NPC dialogue
- Quest generation
- Random encounters
- Combat summaries

It appears to use a "mistral" model by default with a system prompt that directs the AI to act as a D&D Dungeon Master and keep responses concise.

### Visual Display (rich_game_display_integration.py)

The game uses the Rich library to create a terminal-based UI that displays:

- Character stats and status
- Combat logs
- Turn information
- Game progress

The `RichGameDisplay` class handles rendering of the game interface with panels, tables, and styled text.

### World System (world.py)

The game world is managed through:

- A `World` class that loads locations from configuration
- A `Location` class for individual locations with descriptions and connections
- A `ConnectionManager` that handles movement between locations

### Character Models

Two character implementations exist:
1. `Character` in dnd_game.py - handles gameplay mechanics
2. `Character` in character.py - handles persistence and state management

The persistence model supports saving/loading characters as JSON and tracks inventory, equipment, and character progression.

## Game Flow

The game initialization and main loop appear to be in `main.py`, which:

1. Sets up logging
2. Initializes the game
3. Generates a quest
4. Runs the turn-based game loop
5. Handles combat and narrative generation
6. Concludes the game based on outcome

## Initial Observations

1. The codebase is well-structured with clear separation of concerns
2. The narrative generation using Ollama is an interesting approach to dynamic content
3. The Rich library provides a sophisticated terminal UI without requiring a graphical interface
4. The combat system is detailed with class-specific abilities and status effects
5. The project uses a configuration-based approach for world building

## Next Steps

1. Examine the test files to understand testing approach
2. Look deeper at the AI integration with Ollama
3. Investigate how the combat system works in detail
4. Study the self-playing game capabilities
5. Review the logging system for debugging and game events
