- `tests/pixellab_api_test/test_pixellab_api.py` - Now reads from `PIXELLAB_API_KEY` env var
- All example files - Now read from `PIXELLAB_API_KEY` env var
- Created `.env.example` and `.mcp.json.example` templates
- Added comprehensive security documentation in `PIXELLAB_API_SETUP.md`

## Issues Found & Resolved

### Issue #1: Import Error ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** `ImportError: cannot import name 'ImageSize' from 'pixellab'`

**Root Cause:** Classes in SDK submodules, not main package

**Fix:** Updated imports to use correct paths:
```python
from pixellab.models import ImageSize
from pixellab.types import Outline, Shading, Detail, CameraView, Direction
from pixellab.animate_with_skeleton import SkeletonFrame
```

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and verified

### Issue #2: API Key Clarity ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** README didn't clearly state users need their own API key

**Fix:** Updated README Quick Start and Configuration sections to explicitly require API key setup

**Status:** ✅ Fixed
