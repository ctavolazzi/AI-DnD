## Option A: Unify Duplicate Classes

### Description
Merge conflicting Character and Location class implementations into single canonical versions.

### Tactical Plan
1. Merge `dnd_game.Character` + `character.py` → canonical Character class
2. Add `inventory: Inventory` field to Character
3. Merge `world.py` + `world_builder.py` → canonical Location class
4. Update all imports and references
5. Run tests, fix breakages
6. Delete deprecated files

### Scoring Matrix

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Impact** | 9/10 | Eliminates fundamental architectural confusion, enables integration |
| **User Value** | 4/10 | Indirect - users won't see immediate changes |
| **ROI** | 9/10 | High impact for 1-2 hours work (9÷1.5 ≈ 6) |
| **Blocking Factor** | 10/10 | **CRITICAL** - Blocks Options B, C, D, E |
| **Risk** | 7/10 | Medium-low risk, well-scoped changes |
| **Time** | 8/10 | 1-2 hours (fast) |
| **Complexity** | 7/10 | Code merge, but clear boundaries |
| **Tech Debt** | 10/10 | **Massive** debt reduction |
| **Dependencies** | 9/10 | Few dependencies, mostly self-contained |
| **Momentum** | 6/10 | Foundation work, satisfying but not flashy |

## Final Recommendation

### 🏆 **Recommended: Option F - Hybrid Approach**

**Score:** 126/160 (78.8%)

**Reasoning:**
1. **Best ROI** - Fixes critical architecture AND delivers visible feature
2. **Unblocks everything** - Option A enables B, C, D
3. **Manageable scope** - 3-5 hours is doable in one session
4. **Balances foundation + features** - Not just invisible work
5. **Momentum builder** - Two wins in one session
6. **Clear path** - Well-defined phases

### 📋 Execution Plan

**Phase 1: Unify Classes (1.5-2h)**
- Merge Character classes → `dnd_game.Character` as canonical
- Add `inventory: Inventory` field
- Merge Location classes → `world_builder.Location` as canonical
- Update all imports
- Run tests
- **SUCCESS CRITERIA:** All tests pass, no duplicate classes

**Phase 2A: Combat UI (2-3h)** OR **Phase 2B: Polish Bundle (2-3h)**

Choose based on:
- **Energy level:** Combat = complex, Polish = easier
- **Time remaining:** Combat = need focus, Polish = flexible
- **Priorities:** Combat = gameplay, Polish = UX

**Total Estimate:** 3.5-5 hours

### Alternative if Time Constrained: **Option A Only**

If you don't have 3-5 hours:
- Just do **Option A** (1-2 hours)
- Massive impact for minimal time
- Unblocks everything else
- Safe to stop after Phase 1
