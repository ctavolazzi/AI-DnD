Dear Journal,

Today I was involved in an event known as 'Hero 2's Introduction'.

Hero 2 begins the adventure.

This took place at Starting Tavern. I've been here before and it feels familiar. 

This event has given me much to think about. I should reflect on what happened and what it means for my future.

This relates to my quest: Main Quest. I should keep this in mind as I proceed.

Until next time,
Hero 2

I am Hero 2.

A brave Cleric on a grand adventure.

My journey begins now.

*Internal thoughts about Hero 2's Introduction*

I'm not entirely sure how to feel about what just happened. Events like these can be difficult to process immediately.

Being back at Starting Tavern brings back memories. Places hold power over us in ways we don't always acknowledge.

Questions that linger in my mind:

1. How does this event change my path forward?
2. Who can I truly trust among those present?
3. What am I not seeing that might be important?
4. How should I prepare for what comes next?

My quest obligations weigh on my mind:

- Main Quest: How will completing this affect my path? Is it worth the risks involved?

These thoughts are for me alone. Sometimes what we keep inside reveals more truth than what we share with others.
