# Hero 2's Thought - 2025-10-27 12:31:11

## Internal Thought

*Internal thoughts about Hero 2's Introduction*

I'm not entirely sure how to feel about what just happened. Events like these can be difficult to process immediately.

Being back at thornhaven_tavern brings back memories. Places hold power over us in ways we don't always acknowledge.

Questions that linger in my mind:

1. How does this event change my path forward?
2. Who can I truly trust among those present?
3. What am I not seeing that might be important?
4. How should I prepare for what comes next?

My quest obligations weigh on my mind:

- Main Quest: How will completing this affect my path? Is it worth the risks involved?

These thoughts are for me alone. Sometimes what we keep inside reveals more truth than what we share with others.
