# ðŸŽ¬ Quick Start - Interactive Story Theater

## What You Got

A complete **AI-powered story theater** that creates expandable, illustrated D&D adventures. Your choices drive the narrative, and images are automatically generated and placed throughout like an illustrated novel.

## The 3 Things You Asked For âœ…

### 1. Story Generated First â†’ Used for Image Prompts âœ…
- Backend generates the story text FIRST
- AI analyzes the text and extracts 2-3 visual scenes
- Images are created FROM the story (not the other way around)
- Smart prompts based on actual narrative content

### 2. Banner + Peppered Images (Book/Article Layout) âœ…
- Big banner image across the top (16:9 widescreen)
- Story styled like a book (beautiful typography, proper spacing)
- Images automatically peppered throughout chapters
- Positioned at start, middle, or end based on scene analysis

### 3. Chat Window for Continuation âœ…
- Fixed sidebar chat on the right
- Type what you do, press Enter
- AI generates the next chapter with new images
- Story expands downward like a living document
- Save to Obsidian anytime with one click

## Launch It (3 Commands)

```bash
# 1. Make sure you have a Gemini API key in .env
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env

# 2. Run the start script
./start_story_theater.sh

# 3. That's it! Browser opens automatically
```

## Or Start Manually

```bash
# Terminal 1: Story engine
python3 dnd_narrative_server.py

# Terminal 2: Image generator
python3 nano_banana_server.py

# Open in browser
open interactive-story-theater.html
```

## How It Works

```
You type in chat: "I enter the dark cave"
    â†“
AI generates chapter: "You step into the darkness. Ancient runes
glow on the walls. A dragon's roar echoes from deep within..."
    â†“
AI extracts scenes:
  - Scene 1 (start): "Ancient runes glow on the walls"
  - Scene 2 (end): "Dragon's roar echoes from within"
    â†“
Images generated and inserted at those points
    â†“
You see the complete illustrated chapter
    â†“
You type next action: "I cast Light spell"
    â†“
Process repeats, story grows...
```
