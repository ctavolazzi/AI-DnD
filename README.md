# AI-DnD  

## Description  
**AI-DnD** is an **autonomous, AI-driven D&D campaign simulator** that dynamically generates and evolves its own worlds, histories, and characters. This isnâ€™t just a text-based RPGâ€”itâ€™s a **self-running, self-documenting** AI Dungeon Master that **creates, plays, and archives** full campaigns **without human input**.  

### Key Features  
- **Autonomous World-Building** â€“ AI characters make decisions, track history, and generate lore in real time.  
- **Obsidian Integration** â€“ All campaign events, journals, and lore are automatically saved as Markdown files for easy visualization and review.  
- **Sentinel Class** â€“ A monitoring system that ensures narrative and game consistency, acting as a **meta-DM assistant**.  
- **Modular Architecture** â€“ Flexible and expandable, allowing for custom modules and mechanics.  
- **Local-First AI Execution** â€“ Runs offline for privacy and full control, using AI-powered logic to drive campaigns.

## Installation  
To set up **AI-DnD** on your local machine:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ctavolazzi/AI-DnD.git
cd AI-DnD
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Obsidian Setup  
AI-DnD is designed to integrate seamlessly with **Obsidian**, allowing it to generate Markdown-based campaign logs, character journals, and world-building documents in real time.  

### Steps to Set Up Obsidian Integration:  
1. **Download and Install Obsidian**  
   - If you haven't already, download Obsidian from [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) and install it.  

2. **Choose or Create an Obsidian Vault**  
   - Open Obsidian and create a new vault (or use an existing one) where AI-DnD will store campaign logs.  

3. **Configure AI-DnD to Save Logs to Obsidian**  
   - In the AI-DnD `config.json` file, set the `obsidian_vault_path` to your chosen Obsidian vault directory.  

4. **Run AI-DnD and Verify Logs**  
   - Start a new AI-driven campaign and check your Obsidian vault.  
   - AI-DnD will generate campaign logs, character journals, and event summaries in **Markdown format**, making them easy to read and edit within Obsidian.  

5. **Navigate the Campaign in Obsidian**  
   - Open the generated Markdown files in Obsidian to explore the AI-generated world, review past events, and track character development over time.  

## PixelLab Integration

AI-DnD now includes **complete PixelLab integration** with both MCP and direct API access, enabling AI-powered pixel art generation for game development.

### ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
cd pixellab_integration
pip install -r requirements.txt
python examples/01_basic_character_generation.py
```

See [`pixellab_integration/QUICKSTART.md`](pixellab_integration/QUICKSTART.md) for detailed setup.

### Full-Featured Python Client

The `pixellab_integration/` directory provides a complete Python client with:
- Character generation with customizable styles
- Animation creation (walk, run, attack, etc.)
- Multi-directional sprites (4 and 8 directions)
- Rotation and view changes
- Sprite sheet generation
- Game-ready asset workflows

### MCP Integration for Claude Code

AI-DnD also integrates with **PixelLab's Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server, enabling Claude Code to generate game assets through natural language.

### Available Tools

The PixelLab MCP provides the following capabilities:

- **create_character** - Generate pixel art characters with 4 or 8 directional views
  ```python
  create_character(description="fantasy knight", n_directions=8)
  ```

- **animate_character** - Add animations to existing characters (walk, run, idle, etc.)
  ```python
  animate_character(character_id="abc123", animation="walk")
  ```

- **create_topdown_tileset** - Generate Wang tilesets for seamless terrain transitions
  ```python
  create_topdown_tileset(lower="grass", upper="stone path", lower_base_tile_id=0)
  ```

- **create_sidescroller_tileset** - Generate platform tilesets for 2D platformer games
  ```python
  create_sidescroller_tileset(lower="stone brick", transition="moss", base_tile_id=0)
  ```

- **create_isometric_tile** - Create individual isometric tiles
  ```python
  create_isometric_tile(description="medieval tower", size=32)
  ```

### Configuration

The MCP server is configured in `.mcp.json` at the project root. To use PixelLab tools:

1. Ensure you have Claude Code installed
2. The `.mcp.json` file is already configured with the PixelLab API key
3. Restart Claude Code to load the MCP server
4. Use natural language to request asset generation (e.g., "Create a pixel art wizard character with 8 directions")

### Use Cases

- Generate character sprites for the game
- Create tile sets for dungeon environments
- Rapidly prototype visual assets during development
- Generate animated sprites for NPCs and monsters

## Usage
To start AI-DnD:

1. Launch the program from the command line or terminal.
2. Select a pre-made campaign or create your own.
3. Observe the AI-driven adventure unfold.
4. Open Obsidian to view real-time campaign logs.

For additional commands and gameplay mechanics, refer to the user documentation.

### Want a quick peek?
If you just want to see the core combat and logging loop in action without
connecting to Ollama, run the lightweight showcase demo:

```bash
cd examples/simple_demo
python demo_app.py --turns 4
```

The demo swaps in a deterministic narrative engine so you can visualize the
Rich HUD and battle flow immediately.

## Modules  
### Core Components  
- **Character Management** â€“ AI-driven player/NPC attributes, actions, and memory.  
- **Combat System** â€“ Simulated D&D battle mechanics with turn-based AI decision-making.  
- **Dungeon Master AI** â€“ Generates and narrates the world dynamically.  
- **Game State Manager** â€“ Controls the flow of time, events, and interactions.  
- **Sentinel System** â€“ Monitors game consistency and flags discrepancies.  

### Obsidian Integration  
- AI-DnD automatically generates Markdown files to **document campaign history**.  
- Players (or the AI itself) can review and expand on these records in Obsidian.  

## Configuration  
Modify settings in the configuration file to customize:  
- Campaign difficulty  
- AI randomness & decision weight  
- Journal update frequency  
- Obsidian vault path
