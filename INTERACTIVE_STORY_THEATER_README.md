## 🏗️ Architecture

### Story Generation Flow
```
User Input (chat)
    ↓
Backend: /generate-chapter
    ↓
Generate Story Text (Gemini)
    ↓
Extract Visual Scenes (keyword analysis)
    ↓
Return: chapter + scene descriptions
    ↓
Frontend: addChapterWithScenes()
    ↓
Render Chapter HTML
    ↓
For Each Scene:
    ↓
    Generate Image (Nano Banana)
    ↓
    Insert at Position (start/middle/end)
    ↓
Complete Chapter Display
```

### Backend Endpoints

#### `/start-adventure` (POST)
Start a new story session
```json
{
  "character_name": "Thorin",
  "story_prompt": "A quest to find...",
  "model": "gemini"
}
```

#### `/generate-chapter` (POST) ⭐
Generate next chapter with scene extraction
```json
{
  "session_id": "...",
  "player_input": "What you do next",
  "story_context": ["previous chapters..."]
}
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "chapter": {
    "title": "Chapter 1",
    "content": "Story text...",
    "number": 1
  },
  "scenes": [
    {
      "description": "Visual description",
      "position": "start|middle|end",
      "prompt": "Optimized image prompt"

```

### Frontend Functions

#### Core Functions
- `startStory()` - Initialize adventure
- `sendChatMessage()` - Process user input
- `addChapterWithScenes(title, content, scenes)` - Add chapter with images
- `insertSceneImage(chapterNum, sceneData)` - Generate and insert image
- `saveStoryToObsidian()` - Save to vault

#### Image Generation
- `generateBannerImage(prompt)` - Create banner
- Scene extraction handled by backend
- Position-aware insertion (start, middle, end)

## 🎨 Scene Extraction Logic

The backend intelligently extracts visual scenes:

1. **Split narrative into sentences**
2. **Identify visual keywords:**
   - Actions: see, appear, emerge, raise, wield
   - Descriptors: dark, bright, glowing, ancient, massive
3. **Determine position:**
   - First 30% of text → "start"
   - Last 30% of text → "end"
   - Middle 40% → "middle"
4. **Create optimized prompts:**
   - "Fantasy D&D scene: [description], [scene_type] scene, detailed, cinematic"
