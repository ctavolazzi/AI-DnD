# Life RPG Asset Gallery

A collection of pixel art assets designed for a Life RPG prototype application. This project demonstrates asset organization and generation for a gamified life tracking application.

- **Achievement Badges** (10 assets) - Trophy icons for milestones like "First Dollar", "The Flipper", "Boss Mode"
- **Quest Line Icons** (5 assets) - Icons representing quest lines like "Van Life", "Land Fund", "Workshop Path"
- **Stat Icons** (8 assets) - Visual indicators for stats like Cash, Skills, Connections, XP Gain
- **Character Sprites** (4 assets) - Player character and environment sprites
- **UI Elements** (6 assets) - Trophies, quest completion banners, and decorative elements

**Total Assets: 33**

## Viewing the Gallery

Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the interactive asset gallery. The gallery features:

- Organized categories with color-coded sections
- Hover effects and interactive cards
- Click any asset to view it enlarged
- Responsive grid layout
- Asset metadata including names and descriptions

### Local Server (Recommended)

For best results, serve the gallery through a local web server:

```bash
# Using Python
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Generating Assets

### Method 1: PixelLab API (Production Quality)

The `generate_life_rpg_assets.py` script generates high-quality pixel art using the PixelLab API:

```bash
python3 generate_life_rpg_assets.py
```

**Requirements:**
- Valid PixelLab API key (configured in `../.mcp.json`)
- `pip install pillow pixellab`

This script creates:
- 64x64px icons with customizable outlines and shading
- 128x128px character sprites
- Transparent backgrounds
- Isometric and front-view perspectives

### Method 2: Placeholder Generator (No API Required)

The `generate_placeholder_assets.py` script creates labeled placeholder images:

```bash
python3 generate_placeholder_assets.py
```

**Features:**
- No API key required
- Color-coded by category
- Text labels for easy identification
- Instant generation
